 //class is a set of instructions that describe how a data structure should behave. java has its own classes but you can create your own as well. 
 //we need to describe the behavior of the class for it to be useful.


//classes are notated as such:

 // class Dog { 

 //}     class constructor will allow us to create car instances. With
//a class constructor, we can set some information about the car.   The
//class constructor for the Car class     public Car() { 
	// An instance of a class is known as an object in Java.
	//the class constructor and instance variables you can modify the class constructor by adding parameters
	//	//You can think of parameters like options at an ice cream store. You can choose to order a traditional ice cream cone, but other times you may want to specify the size of the cone or the flavor of the ice cream.
// the 'int' parameter must be defined 

//When Java runs your program, the code inside of the main method is executed.
////Our new method to help us get "started"
    //public void startEngine() {

       // System.out.println("Vroom!");
       //true && false evaluates to false.




	//When we create a new class, we probably have specific details that we want the class to include. We save those specific details into instance variables.
